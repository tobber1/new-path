			"That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say.
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May.
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June.
         </p>
         
         <p>
I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem,
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream.
But I don't let it get me down
'cause this fine old world keeps spinnin' around.
         </p>
         
         <p>
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing,
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race."
